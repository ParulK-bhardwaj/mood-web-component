# Mood Selector Web Component
The Mood Selector web component is a customizable and interactive UI element that allows users to select different moods. Each mood comes with its unique background color, animated GIF, and a corresponding Spotify music track. Web Components are a new Web Technology that will be the future of Web Development. You may not have seen or used this before but I'm sure you will see more of this in the future!

The MoodSelector web component is implemented using vanilla JavaScript and the Shadow DOM for encapsulation. The component allows dynamic updates to moods and observes changes to the 'moods' attribute.
